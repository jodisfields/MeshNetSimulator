# Mesh Network Routing Algorithm Simulator

This is a simple simulator for sketching mesh network routing strategies in the hopes to find better approaches to mesh routing. Please note that this simulator does not virtualize a TCP/IP stack nor all characteristics of wireless connections. The dynamic nature of MANETs is also not (yet) covered by this simulator.

The simulator is controled via a command line that can also be reached over a network. The output from the simulator is a json files and can be displayed using the [Mesh Graph Viewer](https://github.com/mwarning/MeshGraphViewer/).

The motivation for this project is that community networks such as [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net) struggle with scaling issues of their [MANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network)s. The cause is management traffic caused by hundreds of nodes. But testing new algorithms for scalability is a problem since many nodes are required. That is what this high speed simulator is helping with.

Also part of this repository are [basic information](docs/about_mesh_networking.md) about mesh routing protocols.

Note: While some routing algorithms have been implemented. Most of them are not in a working state right now.

## Overall Workflow

1. Design algorithm
2. Test algorithm (<= MeshNetSimulator)
3. Code program
4. Test on virtual hardware
5. Test on real hardware

### How to Use

Run the program and use the command line commands to create/load a topology. Then select a routing algorithm, perform a few simulation steps and run the test command.

```
$ mkdir ~/simulation
$ cd simulation
$ ./MeshNetSimulator-amd64-linux
Listen for commands on 127.0.0.1:8011
```

Every time toplogy or node state changes, a new `graph.json` file is written. You can use the [GraphViewer](https://github.com/mwarning/GraphViewer) frontend to visualize the topology and node states:

```
$ ./MeshNetViewer-amd64-linux ~/simulation/graph.json --call tcp://127.0.0.1:8011 --config config.json --open
```

Now the web browsers opens and commands can be passed to the MeshNetSimulator from the command line in the web browser interface. Results will be displayed.
